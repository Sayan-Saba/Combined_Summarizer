There are 3 python files inside the repository
Cloud_App and Cloud_App_2 are the codes I used to deploy it in streamlit cloud. The prompt engineering in Cloud_App_2 is better than Cloud_App

Combined_summarizer.py is the source code



****IMPORTANT****
Inorder to use the program to summarize videos that are upload from local machine, in the python file add a temporary path for the video to
be saved inorder to get the transcription and to summarize


Add both of these to .env file
Install requirements.txt after creating and activating a python environment
Finally run it using streamlit run Combined_Transcriber.py
